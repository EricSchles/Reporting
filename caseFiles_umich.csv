Plaintiffs brought suit under the Alien Tort Statute for violations of Customary International Law.  According to the complaint, the Defendant organizations removed Plaintiffs from their native lands and told Plaintiffs their parents had deceased.  The organizations told Plaintiffs' parents that they were to be educated in Australia and then would be returned home after completing their education.  Plaintiffs allege that, when they arrived at the farms and continuing thereafter, they were subjected to corporal punishment and threats of physical violence and forced to perform arduous work several hours a day for seven days of the week.  Plaintiffs allege they received no education, but that the Defendant organizations accepted educational subsidies for Plaintiffs' schooling, that any identification documentation they had were confiscated and they were routinely hired out to labor at other farms by the Defendant organizations.  All Plaintiffs were school-age minors at the time of the challenged actions.  Plaintiffs' class action was dismissed for lack of subject matter and personal jurisdiction and also on statute of limitation grounds.

The court held that: (1) the allegations failed to satisfy relevant actus reus and mens rea standards under international law for aiding and abetting; (2) the complaint did not identify any conduct by the defendants that materially affected the conduct of the Ivorian traffickers; and (3) corporations as such cannot be sued under the Alien Tort Statute because corporate liability is not universal and well defined under international law.

Gonzalez presented evidence that she was living in the United States under fraudulent immigration documents.  A woman (""Marisol"") offered to help her obtain a green card but then seized her immigration documents, refusing to return them unless Gonzalez paid her and engaged in prostitution. Gonzalez, who did not speak English at the time, testified that her captors drove her to locations where she was watched and directed to work.  At times, Gonzalez turned herself into authorities because ""being in jail was preferable to working on the street.""

The judge found Gonzalez's testimony credible and consistent with the notion that ""victims of human trafficking are often too wary of authorities or too traumatized by their experiences to be able or willing to timely report their victimization,"" and vacated her 86 prostitution-related convictions.

In fact, when she arrived and began working at a strip club, she would earn often several hundred dollars a night, but she would be allowed to keep often as little as $20. Othere women were in the same situation as her, and many were prostituted while in captivity. In addition to confiscating money, Mishulovich kept the women from leaving through tactics including confiscation of documents, physical violence, threats and threats against family members. They initially lived in one apartment in Chicago, which they could leave under strict restrictions. Later, however, they were moved into Mishulovich's apartment which they were not permitted to leave for reasons other than going to work. In his apartment, the women were often forced to do household chores. Linda told Mishulovich that she wanted to leave, but he became so agigated that she, fearful for her safety, told him she changed his mind. To cope with their situation, the women resorted to alcohol. Linda's freedom was eventually bought for $5000 and a watch by a man she met at the strip club.

She brought both women on fraudulent British passports.

Bello forced both women to work in her home and care for her daughter.  She verbally and physically abused the young women, beating them with a wooden spoon, shoes, electric cords and her hands.  Although Bello had an upscale home and modern appliances, the young women were forced to sleep on the floor or a couch, to bath out of a bucket, to eat spoiled food, deprived of sleep, hand-wash clothing and dishes and manually cut the lawn with a long knife.  The women were never sent to school or paid and were not allowed to interact with anyone without Bello present.

The first young woman escaped with the help of another woman while Bello was at a party.  Bello then went to Nigeria to recruit the second young woman.  The second young woman was eventually able to escape by saving money for a cab given to her by friends of Bello.

Bello received her citizenship while committing these crimes.  She will be deported back to Nigeria after serving her sentence.   The two young women have received T-visas.

The victim was then traded to the second defendant, Guadalupe Reyes-Rivera, in South Carolina to engage in prostitution in that state. While in South Carolina, the victim was forced by the third defendant, Ciro Bustos-Rosales, to have sex with dozens of men each day, before she was rescued by U.S. Immigration and Custom officials. 

All three defendants were indicted for conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking and coercion of a minor female with intent to engage in prostitution. The 20-count indictment contained various immigration charges, including brining in and harboring aliens and importing aliens for an immoral purpose. 

Perez-Laguna pled guilty to conspiracy charges, sex trafficking by force or fraud, coercion of a minor, and interstate transport of a minor with intent to engage in prostitution. He was sentenced to 170 months in prison and ordered to pay $52,500 restitution to his victims. Bustos-Rosales plead guilty to conspiracy charges and was sentenced to 70 month in prison and ordered to pay similar restitution. The third defendant included in the indictment, Guadalupe Reyes-Rivera, remains a fugitive. 

On appeal in 2009, Perez-Laguna argued that the plea agreement he signed required an additional sentence reduction that the Government failed to grant. The appellate court affirmed the convictions, but vacated the sentence and remanded to trial court for resentencing. It appears from the docket that at resentencing, the court reduced Perez-Laguna's sentence to 168 months and waived the restitution. Approval Status:ApprovedApprover Comments: EDIT"

The Ferrells promised the victims employment at the hotel for 40 hours a week at $6.05 per hour. When the workers arrived, the Farrells confiscated their visas and passports. The Ferrells forced the victims to work for up to 18 hours a day at the hotel and local fast food restaurants. The Farrells also compelled the workers to sign debt contracts for the costs of transportation to the United States and for purported visa fees. Because of their low wages - the Ferrells paid the workers roughly half of their promised wage - and charges incurred under the debt contact - the victims handed over upwards of 90 percent of their earnings to the Ferrells. The defendants housed the 9 workers in a rented two-room house.  

The Ferrells used threats of deportation and legal sanction as a primary means of controlling the workers. Robert Ferrell specifically threatened to ship the workers back to the Philippines in a box if they refused to comply with the defendants' demands. Defendants also used these and other threats to dissuade the victims from reporting their conditions to law enforcement.

supplied undocumented migrant farm laborers to Florida citrus growers. After smuggling
workers from Mexico to Florida, defendants used physical violence and threats

they had repaid their smuggling debt.
Federal authorities began investigating the defendants after being contacted
by a local workers rights organization. 
In June 2002, a federal jury found the brothers guilty on all four counts.  They were subsequently sentenced to 147 months imprisonment.
On appeal, the Court of Appeals vacated and remanded in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Scheidler, which prohibited convictions for offenses based on extortion that did not involve the actual acquisition of property. On remand, the district court imposed a 180 month sentence based on convictions for conspiracy to violate the law of the United States and harboring illegal aliens.Approval Status:ApprovedApprover Comments: EDIT"

Defendant Mubang took the girl from her parents in Cameroon, promising them that the girl, Evelyn Chumbow, would receive American education and would lead a better life than in Cameroon. She then transported the girl through London using a false passport for Chumbow. Once at Defendant's home in Greenbelt, Maryland, however, Chumbow was forced to serve as a nanny to Defendant's sons, was required to cook and clean, and was isolated from the Maryland community and never allowed to speak with her family back in Cameroon. Chumbow slept on the floor and cared for the children around-the-clock. Defendant Mubang prohibited her from opening the door of the house or leaving the house for any reason other than the completion of specific household tasks. Chumbow was never sent to school or allowed to communicate with children her age. Defendant Mubang subjected Chumbow to continued verbal and physical abuse, often beating her with belts and high-heel-shoes to the extent that the girl would start bleeding or the girl's skull would ooze bodily fluids from the hits with the high-heel shoe. Chumbow escaped from Defendant's house while Defendant Mubang was at a weekend conference. Notably, about a year prior to Chumbow's enslavement, Defendant Mubang had similarly enslaved another young girl from Cameroon. She had sent her back to Cameroon, however, because the girl had started calling the police. Additionally, after Chumbow escaped, Mubang brought over another girl from Cameroon, enslaving her as well. That victim ran away, as well.

Mubang fled the United States after she was convicted, but before sentencing took place. She was sentenced to 17.5 years in prison in absentia. In May, 2005, she was caught in Cameroon and sent back to the United States to begin to serve her sentence.

O'Dell lured a total of five seasonal workers from Jamaica to work at defendants
tree removal company in New Hampshire. On
two separate occasions, the defendants travelled to Jamaica to recruit workers.
The men who agreed to come to the United States were promised wages of between $10-20
per hour and lodging on defendants property.
Once in the United States, victims were paid less than the promised
wage and were housed in substandard conditions. Force example, the first two
workers were forced to live in a camping trailer which initially lacked basic
necessities like running water and heat. To maintain control over the victims,
the defendants subjected the workers to verbal assaults, threats, and and physical
abuse. Defendants also confiscated victims identity documents and plane
tickets. When one of the initial
recruits fled to New York, Bradley, in the presence of the remaining worker, threatened
to travel to New York with his gun to track down the runaway. After the defendants recruited a second group
of workers to New Hampshire, ODell told the three men that Bradley
planned to hire someone in Jamaica to destroy the victim who fled to New
York. Defendants also impeded the victims
access to medical care and closely monitored their movements outside of
defendants property. 
Eventually, several workers fled the property and contacted local law
enforcement. A federal jury convicted the defendants on a number of counts
related to the forced labor scheme. In
January 2004, Bradley and O'Dell were each sentenced to 70 months imprisonment.
An appeals court vacated
defendants sentences and remanded the case for more proceedings to address
possible mitigating circumstances that might have reduced defendants sentence.  In 2006, the district court declined to alter the sentences.
